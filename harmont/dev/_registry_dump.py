"""Local-driver registry dump.

Walks ``harmont._deploy.DEPLOYMENTS`` in topo order, lowering each
``LocalDeployment`` to the JSON shape described in
``docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-21-hm-dev-deploy-design.md`` § 1.
Non-local deployments are passed through as ``{"driver": X,
"_unhandled": true}`` so the CLI can render them in ``hm dev ls``.

Step-chain deployments emit their pipeline as the existing v0 IR via
``harmont.pipeline()``; cache-keys are resolved through the standard
keygen path so the Rust executor can use the terminal key as the
build-image tag without re-running the algorithm.
